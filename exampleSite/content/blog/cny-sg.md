### Chinese New Year in Singapore
It's been a week since I've been in Singapore now. For the first weekend it was Chinese New Year here so there were a lot of shops closed and small events happening all through out the country. We went to a few Hindu Temples on Saturday as well as the Chinatown area. The buddhist temple was decorated with lanterns and many cute popups! Since it is the year of the dragon, there are a lot of dragon popups scattered through out the city.

On Sunday we visited Gardens by the Bay and saw the decorations around the SuperTree Grove. There was a drone show on Sunday evening and it was so crowded - it felt like everyone from the city came to it. We walked around and sat by the water from daylight to sunset that day.

### The Little Things
It has been down pouring at random times through out the day here. One minute it will be sunny, the next it will rain hard for 5 or 10 minutes. Luckily there are covered walkways to all major stations and shopping areas here. You don't even need an umbrella at times if you stick to populated areas!
