### Chinese New Year in Singapore
It's been a week since I've been in Singapore now. For the first weekend it was Chinese New Year here so there were a lot of shops closed and small events happening all through out the country. We went to a few Hindu Temples on Saturday as well as the Chinatown area. Since it is the year of the dragon, there are a lot of dragon popups around the city!

On Sunday we visited Gardens by the Bay and saw the decorations around the SuperTree Grove. There was a drone show on Sunday evening and it was so crowded - it felt like everyone from the city came to it. We walked around and sat by the water from daylight to sunset that day. 



### The Little Things
It has been down pouring at random times through out the day here. One minute it will be sunny, the next it will rain hard for 5 or 10 minutes. Luckily there are covered walkways to all major stations and shopping areas here. You don't even need an umbrella at times if you stick to populated areas!
