### Chinese New Year in Singapore
It's been a week since I've been in Singapore now. For the first weekend it was Chinese New Year here so there were a lot of shops closed and small events happening all through out the country. We went to a few Hindu Temples on Saturday as well as the Chinatown area. Since it is the year of the dragon, there are a lot of dragon popups around the city!

On Sunday we visited Gardens by the Bay and saw the decorations around the SuperTree Grove. There was a drone show on Sunday evening and it was so crowded. It reminded me of New York in a way. It was still very cool to see one.
